When the pump pushes blood, it creates pressure inside the hoses. This pressure is essential to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all your organs and tissues.\\n\\n**How it\\'s Measured (The Two Numbers):**\\n\\nBlood pressure is expressed as two numbers, typically written as a fraction (e.g., 120/80 mmHg):\\n\\n1.  **Systolic Pressure (the top number):** This is the higher number and represents the pressure in your arteries when your heart **beats** (contracts) and pushes blood out.\\n2.  **Diastolic Pressure (the bottom number):** This is the lower number and represents the pressure in your arteries when your heart is **at rest** (between beats) and filling with blood.\\n\\nThe unit \"mmHg\" stands for millimeters of mercury, which is the standard unit for measuring pressure in this context.\\n\\n**What the Numbers Mean (General Guidelines for Adults):**\\n\\n*   **Normal:** Less than 120/80 mmHg\\n*   **Elevated:** Systolic between 120-129 and diastolic less than 80\\n*   **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 1:** Systolic between 130-139 or diastolic between 80-89\\n*   **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 2:** Systolic 140 or higher or diastolic 90 or higher\\n*   **Hypertensive Crisis:** Systolic higher than 180 and/or diastolic higher than 120 (requires immediate medical attention)\\n\\n**Why is Blood Pressure Important?**\\n\\n*   **Too Low (Hypotension):** If your blood pressure is too low, your organs might not get enough blood, leading to symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or even shock in severe cases.\\n*   **Too High (Hypertension):** This is often called the \"silent killer\" because it usually has no symptoms. Over time, high blood pressure can damage your arteries, heart, brain, kidneys, and eyes. It significantly increases your risk of serious health problems like:\\n    *   Heart attack\\n    *   Stroke\\n    *   Heart failure\\n    *   Kidney disease\\n    *   Vision loss\\n\\nRegular blood pressure checks are crucial because they can detect problems early, allowing for lifestyle changes or medication to manage it and prevent severe complications.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--22e12d4d-36b3-478e-a0c1-2f1fae87df10-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 1637, 'total_tokens': 1643, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1093}})"
